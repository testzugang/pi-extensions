# @fgladisch/pi-bash-approval

## 0.2.8

### Patch Changes

- [`d2ce9a9`](https://github.com/fgladisch/pi-extensions/commit/d2ce9a91d0f554f49a0676521c914a4d66e21741) Thanks [@fgladisch](https://github.com/fgladisch)! - Treat background `&` and grouping parentheses as shell syntax during bash approval splitting so grouped dev-server commands suggest clean allow-list rules.

## 0.2.7

### Patch Changes

- [#37](https://github.com/fgladisch/pi-extensions/pull/37) [`6c18825`](https://github.com/fgladisch/pi-extensions/commit/6c18825f2ee194817c9be03cd24ef4181b06b4cd) Thanks [@testzugang](https://github.com/testzugang)! - Add inter-extension lifecycle events for remote prompt and bash approval mirroring with first-response-wins callbacks.

## 0.2.6

- Ignore heredoc bodies during bash approval command splitting so literal commit message content is not suggested as an allow-list command.

## 0.2.5

- Require nested backtick, command, and process substitutions to match bash approval rules.

## 0.2.4

- Add a command-only allow-list prompt option for bash approvals.

## 0.2.3

- Evaluate command substitutions inside assignment tokens by their inner command so bash approval suggestions no longer offer invalid flag prefixes like `-d ...):*`, and assignment-prefixed commands check setup substitutions before the main command.

## 0.2.2

- Ignore redirection-only shell group segments when suggesting bash approval rules.
- Avoid splitting bash approval command chains on separators inside command substitutions.

## 0.2.1

- Ignore shell condition-test segments (`[ ... ]`, `[[ ... ]]`, `test ...`) during approval matching so prompts no longer suggest invalid rules like `[ -f:*`.
- Move extension settings/split parser types from `extensions/utils.ts` to `extensions/types.ts` for clearer type ownership.

## 0.2.0

- Migrate configuration to `~/.pi/agent/.bash-approval` (rules) and `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` (`bashApproval.splitChains`) instead of `bash-approval.json`.
- Improve shell-chain parsing by ignoring control/declaration scaffolding (`if/then/fi`, `for/do/done`, assignment-only segments) and evaluating real command segments.
- Update reload/help text and non-interactive block reason to point to new config paths.

## 0.1.0

- Initial release of interactive bash allow-list guard.
